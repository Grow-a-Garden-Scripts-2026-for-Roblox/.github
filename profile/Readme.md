# Grow a Garden Scripts 2026 — Auto Farm, Dupe, Infinite Resources, Keyless

Comprehensive collection of up-to-date Lua scripts for the Roblox game Grow a Garden (as of February 2026). All scripts are keyless — no key system required — and run instantly on PC and mobile devices (Delta, Arceus X, Fluxus, Hydrogen, Solara, and more). They fully automate gameplay: planting, watering, fertilizing, instant harvesting, selling, rebuying seeds/eggs/gears, duplicating pets/seeds/fruits, farming events (Candy Blossom, Safari, Trader Update, Fall Market, Summer Fruit, Zen rewards, and more), plus infinite Sheckles, seeds, pets, and inventory overflow.

This is a curated hub of the most stable and frequently updated scripts from open sources. Perfect for complete automation, fast progression, and maximizing rewards without manual grinding.

- Dupe: pets, seeds, fruits, Sheckles
- Spawner: legendary pets, rare seeds, event items
- Infinite: money, seeds, inventory slots
